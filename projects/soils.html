  <h3><a href="/projects.html">PORTFOLIO</a> | monument to bygone soils: m. arch thesis</h3>
  
  <p>UC Berkeley <em>M.Arch Thesis</em>, Spring 2023<br><br>
Soil is a dynamic and complex medium that has the potential to act as a historical archive, recording information about past environments, human activities, and natural processes. The agency of soil &mdash; its ability to act upon and influence its surroundings &mdash; is often repressed in the construction of cities, as it is treated merely as a passive substrate for buildings and infrastructure. The Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City stands as a symbol of the country&#39;s rich cultural heritage and religious significance. However, its foundation rests over the historically charged strata buried beneath it. Mexico City&#39;s unique soil conditions have been shaped by geological processes and human activity. The city&#39;s highly compressible soil settles and shifts over time, causing sinking and cracking aboveground. By recognizing and acknowledging the agency of the soil, the Monument to Bygone Soils reveals the complex interplay among history, natural processes, and built systems.</p>

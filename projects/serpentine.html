  <h3><a href="/projects.html">PORTFOLIO</a> | serpentine pool: daylight analysis</h3>
  <p>Collaborated with: Keaton Nemes, Cypress Erbez-Benson and Tagui Martirosyan<br>
  UC Berkeley <em>Advanced Study of Energy and Environment</em>, Spring 2022</p>
  <p>The Serpentine Pool is designed with the intention of emulating the atmospheric condition similar to a cave or grotto. Light is used as a method to guide an individual through the space. While not significantly reflective, the brick walls capture the sunlight and act as a thermal mass. Underwater, the pool is clad with white tiles, amplifying the reflectivity of the pool. The daylighting strategy is to use top lighting that follows the curve of the form, with an opposing edge curving up that will catch and reflect southern light down into the indoor pool below. This reduces the amount of direct light that enters the space in order to create a more ambient lighting experience. As the sun moves across the sky, slivers of light travel across the interior wall of the building. Cliamate Studio was used to analyze DF, UDI, glare, point in time illuminance and DGP, resulting in iterations that optimized the design.</p>

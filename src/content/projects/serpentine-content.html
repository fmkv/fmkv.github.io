    The Serpentine Pool is designed with the intention of emulating the
    atmospheric condition similar to a cave or grotto. Light is used as a method
    to guide an individual through the space. While not significantly
    reflective, the brick walls capture the sunlight and act as a thermal mass.
    Underwater, the pool is clad with white tiles, amplifying the reflectivity
    of the pool. The daylighting strategy is to use top lighting that follows
    the curve of the form, with an opposing edge curving up that will catch and
    reflect southern light down into the indoor pool below. This reduces the
    amount of direct light that enters the space in order to create a more
    ambient lighting experience. As the sun moves across the sky, slivers of
    light travel across the interior wall of the building. Cliamate Studio was
    used to analyze DF, UDI, glare, point in time illuminance and DGP, resulting
    in iterations that optimized the design.

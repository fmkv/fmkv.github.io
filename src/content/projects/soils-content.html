    Soil is a dynamic and complex medium that has the potential to act as a
    historical archive, recording information about past environments, human
    activities, and natural processes. The agency of soil &mdash; its ability to
    act upon and influence its surroundings &mdash; is often repressed in the
    construction of cities, as it is treated merely as a passive substrate for
    buildings and infrastructure. The Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City
    stands as a symbol of the country&#39;s rich cultural heritage and religious
    significance. However, its foundation rests over the historically charged
    strata buried beneath it. Mexico City&#39;s unique soil conditions have been
    shaped by geological processes and human activity. The city&#39;s highly
    compressible soil settles and shifts over time, causing sinking and cracking
    aboveground. By recognizing and acknowledging the agency of the soil, the
    Monument to Bygone Soils reveals the complex interplay among history,
    natural processes, and built systems.
